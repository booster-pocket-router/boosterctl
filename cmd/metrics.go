var metricsCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "metrics `query`",
	Short: "Execute `query` on the local Prometheus server, if available",
	Long: `Perform an HTTP request to "/metrics.json" with the provided query. The request
is forwarded to the local Prometheus server instance if available. Enclose the query into quotes
if it contains spaces.
Some query examples:
  - sum by (source) (booster_network_receive_bytes) # Count of received bytes
  - sum by (source) (rate(booster_network_receive_bytes{}[10s])*8) # Download bandwidth

Note that these are executed as instant queries, i.e. their results refer to the current instant.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// metricsCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// metricsCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
